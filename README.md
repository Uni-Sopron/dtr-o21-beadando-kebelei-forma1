## About the Project üèéÔ∏è

The project simulates a Formula 1 inspired car race. There are three different models to choose from. Each has advantages but disadvantages as well. The result of a model is an optimal tyre strategy that shows in which lap which tyre compounds are worth using. The goal is to complete the race in the shortest possible time.

Total time: 811.529 second

The basic data of the race is in the `basic_data.dat` file.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Uni-Sopron/dtr-o21-beadando-kebelei-forma1.git
cd dtr-o21-beadando-kebelei-forma1/
```

### Install GLPK

If you are using windows, download [GUSEK](http://gusek.sourceforge.net/gusek.html) (GLPK Under Scite Extended Kit)

GLPK for Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install glpk-utils
```

## Model 1
It is pretty slow and doesn't deal with the time loss from the tyre degradation. However it deals with the number of the tyre changes, which means that in each case the best strategy will be used.

### How to start

```bash
glpsol -m model_1.mod -d basic_data.dat
```

## Model 2
The improved version of Model 1. It's very slow but it's advantage, that it deals with the time loss from the tyre degradation. It deals with the number of the tyre changes, which means that in each case the best strategy will be used.

### How to start

```bash
glpsol -m model_2.mod -d basic_data.dat -d degradation.dat
```

## Model 3
Extremly fast. It doesn't deal with the time loss from tyre degradation. The number of the tyre changes needs to be provided in advance, which can be an advantage but if we don't want to provide this data in advance, then we can try out the model with multiple numbers of tyre changes. This requires less time in multple cases rhan Model 1.

### How to start

```bash
glpsol -m model_3.mod -d basic_data.dat -d tyre_change.dat
```
